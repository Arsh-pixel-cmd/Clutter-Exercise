# 📂 Clutter Exercise (Node.js + Express)

A Node.js + Express backend project that organizes and declutters files inside a directory by sorting them into folders based on their file extensions.

For example:

**Before:**
- name.jpg  
- name.png  
- this.pdf  
- arsh.zip  
- harry.zip  
- cat.jpg  


**After:**
📂 jpg/
├── name.jpg
├── cat.jpg
📂 png/
├── name.png
📂 pdf/
├── this.pdf
📂 zip/
├── arsh.zip
├── harry.zip
